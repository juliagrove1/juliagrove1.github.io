                        Young adults often donâ€™t know their drinking tolerance. Coming into a new environment and not being familiar with how much you can drink without going too far is a big problem. People end up drinking way too much and end up throwing up, or even in the hospital. Our solution should provide users with a way to easily track how much they have drank and how much they can drink without going too far.
